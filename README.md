# BoundingBox_Dataset, DiversePageFormats_Dataset, and LineSegmentation_Dataset

This repository contains datasets curated to advance research in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document image analysis, with a focus on low-resource languages like Tamil. These datasets include comprehensive annotations, ground truths, and metadata designed to evaluate system performance across diverse tasks, including:

- Diverse page formats and special categorizations
- Line-by-line segmentation
- Bounding-box segmentation

The datasets are structured to assess and evaluate the performance of OCR systems across a range of conditions, including  diverse page formats, varying noise levels, mono/multilingual text, and printing technologies.

## Repository Structure

### Datasets Overview
- **LineSegmentation_Dataset**
  - Contains data of line-level segmentation.
  - Subdirectories:
    - `Ground truth texts`: Text files with ground truth information for each line.
    - `Line by line Cropped Images`: Cropped images corresponding to individual text lines.
    - `Source Images`: Original document images from which lines were extracted.

- **DiversePageFormats_Dataset**
  - Designed for diverse page format analysis.
  - Subdirectories:
    - `Images`: Document images in various page formats.
    - `Texts`: Associated text files for the corresponding document images.
    - `metadata_table.json`: Metadata providing details about the images and texts.

- **BoundingBox_Dataset**
  - Provides bounding box segmentation dataset.
  - Subdirectories:
    - `Bounding Boxes`: Contains bounding box annotations in a standardized format.
    - `Images`: Document images associated with bounding box annotations.
    - `Texts`: Ground truth text files related to the document images.

## Usage

## Metadata

The `metadata_table.json` file in the DiversePageFormats_Dataset provides structured metadata about the associated images and texts. It includes information such as:
- Image Information: Contains details about the image format, memory size, resolution, sheet color, image condition, width, and height.
- Data Information: Attributes such as font style, font size, resource type, script, number of languages, genre, domain, and content format.
- Data Source Information: Provides context about the documentâ€™s origin and historical background, supporting traceability such as title, subtitle, alternative title, parallel title, author, publisher, edition, year, printing place, type of material, printing technology, ISBN/ISSN, and Copyright.
