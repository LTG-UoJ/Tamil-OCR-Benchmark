I consider it a great pleasure to meet 
Mr. Sivakolunthu about whom I have heard 
and read but never had the opportunity 
of meeting him before this. I believe his 
greatest contribution to education has been 
to give to children and teachers the wealth 
of his experience and knowledge through 
the medium of his text - books. Today in 
Ceylon we have just a few men like him 
who are devoting their time energy and 
life to the cause of the improving education 
in the Tamil medium in all our schools. 
His work will always remain the foundation 
and source of inspiration for the development 
of education among the Tamil 
speaking people of the island.

It is with great pleasure I went through 
the publications of Mr. V. Sivakolunthu in 
Geography, Mathematics & Arithmetic. By 
bringing out these books at this time when 
complaints are made of shortage in Tamil 
Texts I am of opinion he has rendered a very 
valuable service to our country-particularly 
to the Tamil Nad. Let us encourage him 
in his work by patronising his publications.
