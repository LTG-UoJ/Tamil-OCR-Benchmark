THIS work is designed to be a complete Grammar of the Tamil 
language in both its dialects. It is hoped that nothing of importance 
has been omitted.
It is divided into two parts, the first being a full exposition, in 
question and answer, of the Grammar of the language, with copious 
examples so arranged as to form a series of reading lessons. The 
second part consists of the Native authorities, to. which appeal is 
commonly made in doubtful cases.
A Grammatical Vocabulary has been added. The work is intended 
for private Students, Indian and European, as well as for the highest
Classes in Colleges and Schools.
TANJORE, February, 1857.
TO THE SECOND EDITION.
The whole has been thoroughly revised, the commentary to the 
Nann√ªl greatly enlarged, and numerous additional references inserted. 
It will be observed that in many cases transmutations required by
rule have not been attended to. The second edition of the Tamil 
Poetical Anthology is intended to be the companion to this Grammar, 
and contains references to it throughout.
